The structure of this directory could serve as an example (though other ways of
working with /colporter/ are imaginable) for any site built with colporter. The
following table briefly explains the purpose of the files and directories.


+-----------------+-------------------------------+
|dir/file         |purpose                        |
+-----------------+-------------------------------+
|assets/          |a directory which contains     |
|                 |(static) files,                |
|                 |e.g. CSS-stylesheets, JavScript|
|                 |files etc                      |
+-----------------+-------------------------------+
|content/         |a directory which contains the |
|                 |content of the site (i.e. .md  |
|                 |files with an additional       |
|                 |YAML-block that contains       |
|                 |further page-specific data     |
|                 |(e.g. the title of the page,   |
|                 |tags etc.)                     |
+-----------------+-------------------------------+
|main.lisp        |the main lisp program using    |
|                 |/colporter/ which eventually   |
|                 |generates the site from the    |
|                 |content by assembling the      |
|                 |actual html pages and other    |
|                 |data by applying the templates,|
|                 |snippets etc.                  |
+-----------------+-------------------------------+
|upload-site.sh   |this shell scripts serves as an|
|                 |example for uploading a        |
|                 |colporter site to an sftp      |
|                 |server                         |
+-----------------+-------------------------------+
|site/            |this directory contains the    |
|                 |actual site generated by       |
|                 |colporter which could be       |
|                 |further used e.g. for staging  |
+-----------------+-------------------------------+
|snippets/        |a collection of snippet files  |
|                 |which could be used in         |
|                 |templates (e.g. to reduce      |
|                 |redundancy by collecting often |
|                 |repeating elements, e.g. HTML  |
|                 |page headers)                  |
+-----------------+-------------------------------+
|templates/       |the source files containing the|
|                 |templates for pages/posts etc. |
