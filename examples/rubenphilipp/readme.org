* Introduction



* Directory Structure

The structure of this directory could serve as an example (though other ways of
working with /colporter/ are imaginable) for any site built with colporter. The
following table briefly explains the purpose of the files and directories.


| dir/file       | purpose                                                                                                   |
|----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| assets/        | a directory which contains (static) files, e.g. CSS-stylesheets, JavaScript-code, images etc.             |
| content/       | a directory which contains the content of the site (i.e. .yaml files)                                     |
| main.lisp      | the main lisp code using /colporter/ to eventually generate the content by loading all site-specific files (i.e. in this case Lisp code) and finally generating the page by calling the ~make-colporter~ and ~build~ methods in ~rubenphilipp.lisp~ |
| upload-site.sh | this simple shell script serves as an example for uploading a colporter site to an (s)ftp server          |
| site/          | this directory contains the actual site generated by colporter which could then be further used, e.g. for staging purposes |
| snippets/      | a collection of snippet files which could be used in templates (cf. ~insert-snippet~), meant to reduce redundancy by collecting repetitively used elements (e.g. HTML page headers etc.) |
| templates/     | the source files containing the template definitions (e.g. via ~define-template~) for pages/posts/etc. |
