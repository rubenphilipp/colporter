/colporter/ is a static-site generator written in Common Lisp, loosely modeled
after [[https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll][Jekyll]]. Its HTML generation is partly based on [[https://github.com/ruricolist/spinneret][Spinneret]].

Tested with SBCL.

* Usage notes

A tutorial and example projects are coming up soon. For now, refer to
[[https://rubenphilipp.com/colporter]] and the tests (in ~tests/tests.lisp~; esp.
~test-build-colporter~).

** Project structure

- ~/src~. Contains the source code of the project.
- ~/doc~. Contains a documentation generated via [[https://github.com/gumpu/ROBODoc][ROBODoc]].
- ~/tests~. Regression tests via [[https://github.com/lispci/fiveam][fiveam]].
- ~/examples~. Example files for demonstration purposes.

* Requirements

** Lisp-wise

- [[https://www.sbcl.org][SBCL]] (or comparable)
  - currently, /colporter/ is only tested on MacOS with SBCL
- [[https://asdf.common-lisp.dev][ASDF]]

** Server

- Apache 2 (for htaccess support, e.g. for custom error pages and mod_rewrite)
